# Disclaimer regarding the project's support

This project is experimental and you're free to experiment with it at your own risk, but please be aware that at this early stage we do not provide any level of support for it, that especially means cases raised for Snowflake Support.
Please watch this space for updates and thank you for your interest in this product.

# Running Tests

This project contains multiple test suites across different driver implementations. Before running any tests, you'll need to set up common credentials and build the required components.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Decode Secrets

All integration tests require access to Snowflake credentials. To set up the required `parameters.json` file:

```bash
# Install 1Password CLI if not already installed
# Then decode the encrypted parameters file:
./scripts/decode_secrets.sh
```

This will create a `parameters.json` file in the project root containing test credentials.

**Alternative:** If you don't have 1Password CLI installed you can provide encryption password via environment variable:
```bash
PARAMETERS_SECRET=<encryption-password> ./scripts/decode_secrets.sh 
```

**Alternative:** If you want provide different credentials that the standard ones, you can provide parameters.json yourself:

```json
{
  "testconnection": {
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_ACCOUNT": "your-account",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_USER": "your-username",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_PASSWORD": "your-password",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_DATABASE": "your-database",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_SCHEMA": "your-schema",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_WAREHOUSE": "your-warehouse",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_HOST": "your-host.snowflakecomputing.com",
    "SNOWFLAKE_TEST_ROLE": "your-role"
  }
}
```

### 2. Build Core Components

The tests require the Rust core library to be built:

```bash
# Build all Rust components
cargo build

# Or build specific packages
cargo build --package sf_core
cargo build --package jdbc_bridge
```

## Driver-Specific Testing

Each driver implementation has its own testing setup and requirements. See the individual README files for detailed instructions:

- **Python (PEP 249)**: See [python/README.md](python/README.md)
- **Rust Core**: See [sf_core/README.md](sf_core/README.md)
- **ODBC**: See [odbc/README.md](odbc/README.md)
- **JDBC**: See [jdbc/README.md](jdbc/README.md)

## Test Validation

The project includes a test format validator that ensures Gherkin feature files have corresponding implementations:

```bash
# Run validator
./tests/tests_format_validator/run_validator.sh

# Or run directly
cd tests/tests_format_validator/
cargo run
```

## CI/Local Environment Differences

- **Local**: Tests auto-build missing Rust components
- **CI**: Requires pre-built components and explicit environment variables
- **Docker**: Reference tests use containerized official drivers

## Troubleshooting

1. **Missing parameters.json**: Run `./scripts/decode_secrets.sh` or create manually
2. **Missing Rust library**: Run `cargo build --package sf_core`
